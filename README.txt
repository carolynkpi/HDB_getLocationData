This app aims to support home buyers of the Singapore HDB Resale Flats, in making decisions like:
-choosing locations to find a new home efficiently.
-balancing budget against comfort needs such as space, location and convenience. 
-offering a purchase price based on an estimate of the market value. 

The main data source is from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices. The data contains HDB flat resale transactions in 2015-2017. 

The project plan is in 3 phases. 
Phase 1: Data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Phase 2: Getting data from Google API and repeat EDA.
Phase 3: Clustering analysis and predictive analysis. 

Currently, Phase 1 is completed.

Phase 2 is in progress. The codes here are part of Phase 2 which attempts to get additional location data from Google Maps API.
